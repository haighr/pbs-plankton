------------------------------

0.4.0 (2016-05-11)
  • Added an example to the `calcChloro' help file `calcChloro.Rd'. (RH 1605111)
  • Modified function `calcChloro' to fix a small bug in calculating duration that salmon experience the spring bloom. (RH 160511)
  • Modified functions `findDpoly' and `sliceDpoly' to set chlorophyll values of -99 and those >30 to NA. (RH 160511)
  • Added function `sliceDpoly' to slice events located in depth polygons by year or (X,Y) to summarise Z by julian day. (RH 160510)

0.3.0 (2016-05-09)
  • Added function `findDpoly' to find satellite chorophyll events (gridded) in a polygon bounded seaward by a depth contour. (RH 160509)
  • Added function `createDpoly' to create a depth polygon from a single isobath. (RH 160506)
  • Added function `transData' to transpose tabulated geo-referenced data from a file into a data frame. (RH 160506)
  • Added function `dfread' to read a data.frame using the `fread' function from the package `data.table'. (RH 160506)
  • Added function `diffGeo' to transform a geospatial object's coordinates into Cartesian coordinates. (RH/TD 160506)

0.2.0 (2016-04-28)
  • Added function `calcChloro' to smooth satellite  chlorophyll data and estimate bloom magnitude and duration. (RH 160428)
  • Added function `calcDeriv' which is used by `calcChloro'. (RH 160426)
  • Updated the Rnw-based User's Guide. (RH 160426)
  • Updated data object `phytospp' to have Latex-compatible symbols. (RH 160426)

0.1.0 (2016-04-25)
  • Started User's Guide for PBSplankton. (RH 160425)
  • Extracted dataset `phytospp' from `PBSdata'. (RH 160425)
  • Created new package `PBSplankton' using three functions from `PBStools' -- `boxSeason', `plotDiversity', `trackComp'. (RH 160425)
